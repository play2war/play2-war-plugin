		<description homepage="http://xml.apache.org/commons/components/external/">
		xml-commons provides an Apache-hosted set of DOM, SAX, and 
    JAXP interfaces for use in other xml-based projects. Our hope is that we 
    can standardize on both a common version and packaging scheme for these 
    critical XML standards interfaces to make the lives of both our developers 
    and users easier. The External Components portion of xml-commons contains 
    interfaces that are defined by external standards organizations. For DOM, 
    that&apos;s the W3C; for SAX it&apos;s David Megginson and sax.sourceforge.net; for 
    JAXP it&apos;s Sun.
